This is a Go web server built on top of [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/). Its primary new feature is the high-level admin API it adds to all of its public website deployments. You can update any site that this server serves by making a simple HTTP request to this admin API, which makes it very easy to use in build pipelines.

It does some interesting things, but is not finished yet.
