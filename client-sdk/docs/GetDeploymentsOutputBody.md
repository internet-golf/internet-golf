### NewGetDeploymentsOutputBody

`func NewGetDeploymentsOutputBody(deployments []DeploymentBody, ) *GetDeploymentsOutputBody`

NewGetDeploymentsOutputBody instantiates a new GetDeploymentsOutputBody object

and makes sure properties required by API are set, but the set of arguments
will change when the set of required properties is changed

### NewGetDeploymentsOutputBodyWithDefaults

`func NewGetDeploymentsOutputBodyWithDefaults() *GetDeploymentsOutputBody`

NewGetDeploymentsOutputBodyWithDefaults instantiates a new GetDeploymentsOutputBody object

GetDeployments returns the Deployments field if non-nil, zero value otherwise.

### GetDeploymentsOk

`func (o *GetDeploymentsOutputBody) GetDeploymentsOk() (*[]DeploymentBody, bool)`

GetDeploymentsOk returns a tuple with the Deployments field if it's non-nil, zero value otherwise
and a boolean to check if the value has been set.

### SetDeployments

`func (o *GetDeploymentsOutputBody) SetDeployments(v []DeploymentBody)`

SetDeployments sets Deployments field to given value.


### SetDeploymentsNil

`func (o *GetDeploymentsOutputBody) SetDeploymentsNil(b bool)`
